Installation instructions for the firmware:

The Polhemus Liberty (v2) (tm) tracker needs to load firmware onto the chip that controls the USB2 port. For this you will need the 'fxload' program ('apt-get install fxload' in Debian).

Instructions:

Run ./install_udev_firmware.sh  in this directory,

or do the following per hand:

    First, copy the file 70-polhemus.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d/ :
     cp 70-polhemus.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
     apt-get install fxload


    Copy the firmware file and firmware loader to /lib/firmware/polhemus:
     mkdir -p /lib/firmware/polhemus
     cp a3load.hex /lib/firmware/polhemus
     cp LbtyUsb8051.hex /lib/firmware/polhemus

    Reload udev:
     udevadm control --reload-rules


Now when you plug the Liberty tracker, it should show the 0f44:ff21
vendor/product id for a couple of seconds, and then switch to 0f44:ff20
(after it loaded the firmware and restarted the micro-controller)


In case udev is not working correctly for you, you can try to manually load the firmware:
    See lsusb for the correct path in /proc.

    sudo fxload -v -D /dev/bus/usb/001/015 -I LbtyUsb8051.hex -t fx2 -s a3load.hex

Note: The file LbtyUsb8051.hex was graciously provided by Polhemus. Thanks a lot.
